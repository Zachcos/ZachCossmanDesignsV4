          I began my interest in design when I was in my early teens. My cousin
          and I used to find Photoshop tutorials that we liked and would sit on
          the phone for hours while we completed and them. (We compared our
          results by sending them through AOL Instant Messenger... ‚úåüèªüë¥üèª‚úåüèª) From
          there, I dabbled in (terrible) Flash animations and eventually found
          my footing tinkering with late-90's web builders like Yahoo!
          GeoCities, where the restrictions of that platform made me want to
          learn how to write my own code.
          <br />
          <br />
          My first sites were Photoshop designs cut into pieces and reassembled
          for the web with code from Adobe Dreamweaver. Just as I was publishing
          my first site, I got my first dose of just how quickly things change
          in the world of web design and development and began the never-ending
          journey of learning the new tools of the trade. Through table layouts,
          floats, and the rest, I have stayed on a constant hunt for the
          technologies that make sites faster and more versatile, with a
          majority of my current work being built on React with GatsbyJS for
          static-site generation.
          <br />
          <br />
          Since the mid 2000's I have been working on a freelance basis with a
          variety of clients, helping them establish brand identities and
          better-reach their audiences.

          When I'm not behind the computer, you can find me acting on stage or
          playing music, or looking for the nearest Starbucks. ‚òïÔ∏è

          My goal is to create designs that are unique, but simple and
